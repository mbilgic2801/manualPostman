Feature: User login

  Scenario Outline: Successful login with valid credentials
    Given I have login credentials "<username>" and "<password>"
    When I send a POST request to the login endpoint
    Then the response status code should be <status_code>
    And I receive a token in the response
    Examples:
      | username | password    | status_code |
      | admin    | password123 | 200         |


  Scenario Outline: Unsuccessful login with invalid credentials
    Given I have login credentials "<username>" and "<password>"

    Then the response status code should be <status_code>
    Examples:
      | username     | password     | status_code |
